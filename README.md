This is a clone game

## Contribution
### Coders:

We are working with SDL, the plan is to move what little codebase we have to C++. I do want to still be able to interface with Swift and Kotlin code, so that's an interesting issue to tackle.

- C(++) Knowledge
- SDL Knowledge

### Graphics:
We're not yet quite sure which graphics codec we're going to use, but it's likely png, it looks like we have to source our own regardless: https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_PixelFormatEnum
- Spriteart

Optional:
- [Aceprite]

### Music:
Is there a portable DAW file, that works between DAW's? Otherwise we have to use MIDI and somehow map MIDI notes to .wav files ourself.
